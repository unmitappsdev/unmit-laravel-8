# Pipeline to deploy to a server when pushed to master
# and populate .env from Azure Key Vault
#
# MUST DEFINE VARIABLES BEFORE RUNNING
#
# v1.1 - divide into stages 2023-10-19 MH
# v1.0 - initial commit 2023-07-01 Michael Han <mhan1@unm.edu>

# ON TRIGGER AND USE OF THE DEFAULT BRANCH NAME
# Start the pipeline when an update is made to master branch.
# As of 2023, many socially-sensitive companies have switched to main as
# the name for default branch, but git maintains the default branch
# name of master, therefore the master branch is set as the default here
# since we do not rely on any third-party company for our development 
# repositories. Please do change this if the default branch name is
# something else than master.
# ---
trigger:
- master

# ON DECLARING VARIABLES HERE 
# In order to make this file portable, and to possibly prevent unnecessary
# updates to the file itself, the default instructions are to set the variables
# directly on Azure DevOps via the browser, but it is perfectly fine
# to declare the variables here if necessary.
# ---
#variables:
#  variable1: 'value1'
#  variable2: 'value2'
